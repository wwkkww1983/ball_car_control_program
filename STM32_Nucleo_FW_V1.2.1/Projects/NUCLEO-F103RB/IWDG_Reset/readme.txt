@par Example Description

  This example shows how to update at regular period the IWDG reload counter and 
  how to simulate a software fault generating an MCU IWDG reset on expiry of a 
  programmed time period.
  
  The IWDG timeout is set to 250 ms (the timeout may varies due to LSI frequency 
  dispersion then the preload period is set to 220 ms to guarantee a strong behavior).
  
  The program toggle LED2 each 220ms. When user button is pressed, an interrupt is
  generated and a write to a wrong address will be performed. This causes a system
  hard fault then the IWDG counter reaches 00h.       
  As a result, when the IWDG counter reaches 00h, the IWDG reset occurs.
  If the IWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED2 remains
  On for 3 seconds then it is toggled each 220ms.
  
  If the EXTI Line event does not occur, LED2 is toggling and the IWDG counter is 
  indefinitely refreshed in the main program infinite loop, and there is no IWDG reset.


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32NUCLEO kit (MB1136) Rev C 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
