@par Example Description

This example describes how to toggle IO with two different frequency.
This is done using Delay() function which is implemented based on the SysTick 
end-of-count event. 

When starting program, LED2 remain toggling with a frequency equal to ~10Hz 
(a delay of 50ms is put). By pushing the User Button mounted on STM32NUCLEO,
LED2 will toggle with a frequency equal to ~2.5Hz(a delay of 200ms is put).
This is done in an infinite loop.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32NUCLEO Kit(MB1136) Rev C 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.  

@par How to use it? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 + EWARM
    - Open the IO_Toggle.eww workspace 
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
    - Load project image: Project->Debug
    - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
  
 + MDK-ARM
    - Open the IO_Toggle.uvproj project
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
    - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
    - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)   

 + TrueSTUDIO:
    - Open the TrueSTUDIO toolchain.
    - Click on File->Switch Workspace->Other and browse to TrueSTUDIO workspace directory.
    - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace' and then click "Next". 
    - Browse to the TrueSTUDIO workspace directory, select the project IO_Toggle.
    - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" 
      window then click on Project->build project menu.
    - Run program: Run->Debug (F11)
